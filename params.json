  "body": "Proxymity\r\n=========\r\nProxymity is a tool that extracts anonymous proxies using various ways. \r\n\r\nThen it constantly verifies them and tests their capabilities.\r\n\r\nIt scans lots of online websites and employs advanced techniques to bypass protections like Javascript Evaluation and captchas.\r\n\r\nInstallation\r\n============\r\n\r\nThe easiest way to run Proxymity is to use Docker (Described below).\r\n\r\nIf you want to install it in Debian/Ubuntu read below.\r\n\r\nDependencies:\r\n\r\n    1) PhantomJs\r\n    2) gocr\r\n    3) ImageMagick (command line command is convert)\r\n    4) Mysql database/\r\n\r\nAll tools must be installed and added to the path and accessible from the command line.\r\n\r\nUbuntu:\r\n\r\nsudo apt-get install imagemagick gocr phantomjs\r\n\r\nWindows versions are included in the bin folder and used automatically by the code.\r\n\r\nTested on JDK 8.\r\n\r\nWhere are proxies Stored ?\r\n--------------------------\r\n\r\nProxies are stored in the mysql databased provided. You need to provide a mysql database_user/password/database_name. The table is automatically created, along with a stored procedure\r\n\r\ngetRandomProxy()\r\n\r\nThis is called as:\r\n\r\n    getRandomProxy(NULL); - Get any type active proxy\r\n    getRandomProxy('http'); - Get any type active proxy of type http\r\n    getRandomProxy('socks4'); - Get any type active proxy of type socks4\r\n    getRandomProxy('socks5'); - Get any type active proxy of type socks5\r\n\r\nOn a Docker machine you can access the proxies by visiting: http://localhost:81/activeproxies.php?start=0&limit=100\r\n\r\nDocker\r\n======\r\nThe easiest way to run this is with Docker.\r\n\r\nMake sure you have Docker installed. Instructions for all major distributions here:\r\n\r\n    https://docs.docker.com/engine/installation/\r\n\r\nThen run these commands:\r\n\r\n    ./build_docker.sh\r\n    ./run_docker.sh\r\n    \r\n You can see the proxies at http://localhost:81/activeproxies.php?start=0&limit=100\r\n \r\n Adjust start and limit to your linking.\r\n \r\n The output is json and self-explained.\r\n \r\nConfiguration\r\n==============\r\n- config.properties.sample contains all values that can be set.\r\n- Copy config.properties.sample to config.properties and edit it.\r\n- The file for Docker is Docker/config.properties\r\n\r\nWindows\r\n========\r\n\r\nBinaries files are included for portability on windows. You are free to delete bin directory in if not needed.",
